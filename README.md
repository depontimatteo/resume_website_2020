# Resume CV Website - POC Backend REST API with Python Flask

Developing a web application with Backend REST API Layer written in Python with Flask Framework and Frontend Layer developed using Vue.js Framework.

In this branch you can find the backend layer.

You could think: why are you developing from scratch a simple website without using a CMS or a static site generator, perhaps based on Vue.js? The answer is simple: I wanna be more confident with these languages and frameworks and I need to make my hands dirty.
