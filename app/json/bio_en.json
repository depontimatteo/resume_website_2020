I've used chroot jails and Docker as containerization tools. I've studied and realized a CI pipeline using Bitbucket Pipelines and a CD system using Ansible as automation platform. I've used Locust.io as load & stress testing platform. I've configured and used several AWS services, both for building the infrastructure (ELB, EC2, RDS, Route53, API GW, Lambda, etc.) and operations and monitoring (CloudWatch).
